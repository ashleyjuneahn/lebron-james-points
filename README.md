# Lebron James becomes top scorer in NBA

## Abstract

I wrangled data on the top 10 all-time scorers in the NBA for a [story](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/04/1152125147/lakers-pelicans-thunder-score-lebron-james-points-record-kareem-abdul-jabbar) on LeBron James breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring record. The graph shows age versus cumulative points scored in the regular season. Individual CSV files for each player was downloaded from Google Sheets where I pulled data from the NBA website.
